# Goods-To-Consumer-Analysis
Using a Google BigQuery, fictitious ecommerce database, I used SQL and DAX to build a Power BI dashboard for analysis.

## Data Source

[Google BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/) Google Open Datasets, "thelook_ecommerce"

## Project Overview

In this project, I pretended I was given a task by the Vice President of Logistsics to discover any and all major issues with the back end of the ecommerce company's, named "TheLook," supply chain. This led to a Goods-To-Consumer-Type dashboard and analysis. The Vice President wanted a way to quickly injest large amounts of data in a simple, yet holistic, manner in real time.(Knowing this is a Google-generated fictitious database, I was bound to find some things that were odd.)
